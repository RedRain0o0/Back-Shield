# Adds the ability to put Shields in your Back Slot(Trinkets).
Back Sheild is a simple mod which allows you to put a shield on your back.
It functions similarly to TF2's RazorBack, allowing you to be hit from behind without taking damage.
It blocks all damage once, then blocks 50%. It can be disabled with an axe crit.
